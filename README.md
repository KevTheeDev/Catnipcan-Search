Purpose -

Create a search website for cat lovers or just peole who want to look at cats


Problem Statement

 (Cats are easily found on the internet, from random pictures, to memes, and IG pages dedicated to specific cat, but rarely is it informative. I present a web application that makes searching for cats easy and enjoyable, also provides in depth description of the cat's origin and where they are most likely to be found (so it can be potentially easier to buy one from wherever))


Technical Problem Solution
 (It will use an API to provide in depth description of the cat's origin and where they are most likely to be found (so it can be potentially easier to buy one from wherever). 
 A user may be able to click on a cat's name/species and navigate to the the image of that cat or they can search for a cat and get an image, or use an arrow button to click to a random image )

Technical Language
 - 0 - Does not demonstrate accurate programming language during the presentation
 - 1 - Uses language that demonstrates general programming concepts during presentation
 - 2 - Uses accurate programming terminology during presentation that demonstrates work ready skills.
